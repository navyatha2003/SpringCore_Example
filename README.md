# SpringCore_Example

This repository contains simple examples demonstrating **Spring Core concepts** such as **Dependency Injection**, **Bean Configuration**, and **Association between classes** using XML configuration.

---

## 🚀 About the Project
This project shows how to use **Spring Framework’s Core Module** for Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI).

It includes:
- Bean configuration using **applicationContext.xml**
- **Setter** and **Constructor Injection**
- **Association between beans** (like Employee ↔ Department)
- Basic understanding of how the **Spring container** works

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java** (JDK 8+)
- **Spring Core Framework**
- **Eclipse IDE**
- **Maven** for dependency management
